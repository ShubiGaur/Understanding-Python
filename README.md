# Understanding-Python

This repo is designed to track my understanding and knowledge of Python. I refer to solely W3Schools for informational content and all their units are from there.

Source used: https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp

Have made this repository public to help anyone else trying to understand the fundamentals of Python at a slow, adjustable pace of their choosing.
After succesfully cloning my repo, just scroll through to find an exercise of your choice and then:

1. Create a new terminal
2. Navigate to the right unit folder using cd
3. Type and enter "python app[#].py" (#= the number of the file you're on)
4. You should see the output, given you have Python and other necessities installed on your device.
