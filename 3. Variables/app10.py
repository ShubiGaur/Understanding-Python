# Rules for variables in Python:

# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character

# A variable name cannot start with a number

# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )

# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)


# A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.
