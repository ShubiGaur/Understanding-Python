# Lists store multiple items in a single variable

# Lists are created using square brackets... like this:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]


"""
List items are indexed:
First item always has index [0]
Second item has index [1]

"""

# Lists can either be ordered or unordered.

# For ordered lists, if you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the END of the list. Makes enough sense.

# To determine how many items a list has, use the len() function:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] # Making the list 
print(len(thislist)) # When app38.py is ran, it should  print 3 with the objects in there already. Try adding more to see the output change.

# Little more about lists:

# List items can be of any data type:
list1 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] # << String ex.
list2 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 3]               # << Integer ex.
list3 = [True, False, False]          # << Boolean ex.

# A list can contain different data types within the list:
list1 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]
