# There are 4 collection data types in Python:

# We just talked about lists, which is one of them.

# The other three are also important and will be discussed MORE later.

# Just to quickly define them:

"""
List is a collection which is ORDERED and CHANGEABLE. Allows duplicate members.
Tuple is a collection which is ORDERED and UN-CHANGEABLE. Allows duplicate members.
Set is a collection which is UN-ORDERED, UN-CHANGEABLE, and UNINDEXED. No duplicate members.
Dictionary is a collection which is ORDERED and CHANGEABLE. No duplicate members.
