# What is an iterable?

# The iterable can be any iterable object, like a list, tuple, set etc.

# EXAMPLE: You can use the range() function to create an iterable:
newlist = [x for x in range(10)]
print(newlist)

# EXAMPLE: Same as above but accept only numbers lower than 5:
newlist = [x for x in range(10) if x < 5]
print(newlist)
