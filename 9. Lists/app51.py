# You can loop through the list items by using a for loop. Say you had this list for example:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# EXAMPLE: Print all items in the list, one by one:
for x in thislist:
  print(x)

# You can also loop through the list items by referring to their index number.
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for i in range(len(thislist)):
  print(thislist[i])
