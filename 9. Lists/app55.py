# What is the condition?

# The condition is like a filter that only accepts the items that valuate to True.

# EXAMPLE: Only accept items that are not "apple":
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = [x for x in fruits if x != "apple"]
print(newlist)

# In the loop above, "if x != apple" is the condition.

# The conditional is optional and not needed!
