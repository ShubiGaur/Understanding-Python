# Now let's talk numbers.

# There are three numeric types in Python: int, float, and complex.

x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex


# INT
# A whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.

x = 1
y = 35656222554887711
z = -3255522

# FLOAT
# A number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.

x = 1.10
y = 1.0
z = -35.59

# Float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.

# COMPLEX
# Written with a "j" as the imaginary part

x = 3+5j
y = 5j
z = -5j
